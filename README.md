# 🌌 Universe Map

**Universe Map** is an interactive 3D project that aims to visualize the known universe — starting from our Solar System.

## 🚀 About the Project

Universe Map is a long-term personal project focused on building a realistic, explorable 3D map of space using real astronomical data.

Currently, it features a detailed and animated model of the **Solar System**, including accurate scales, axial tilts, and textures.

🔭 In future updates, the project will include **all nearby stars**, based on actual scientific data.

> I work on this project whenever I find the time — it's a labor of love, driven by my fascination with space and 3D visualization.
